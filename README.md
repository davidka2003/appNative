This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# CodePush integration

First you need to install these packages:

```bash
#if u don't have appcenter-cli installed:
npm install -g appcenter-cli

#package
yarn add react-native-code-push

#additional packages
yarn add appcenter appcenter-analytics appcenter-crashes --save-exact
```

Login with appcenter:

```bash
appcenter login
```

Then run this command from root of the project to install ios deps:
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Need to change file AppDelegate.mm:
```c
// Add these imports to the top of AppDelegate.mm or AppDelegate.m file
// AppCenter CodePush
#import <AppCenterReactNative.h>
#import <AppCenterReactNativeAnalytics.h>
#import <AppCenterReactNativeCrashes.h>
#import <CodePush/CodePush.h>
#import "AppDelegate.h"
```

```c
#if DEBUG
  return [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index"];
#else
   //Change this line to return [CodePush bundleURL];
  return [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
#endif
```

Add to info.plist DeploymentKey obtained from appcenter dashboard (Distribute => CodePush):
```xml
<key>CodePushDeploymentKey</key>
<string>Your-deployment-key</string>
```

To deploy app by air (will work only if you haven't changed native dependencies):

```bash
appcenter codepush release-react -a acc/app-name -d Production
```
